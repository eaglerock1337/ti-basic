# ti-basic

A collection of programs written in TI-Basic and Python for TI calculators.

## about

This is my repository of TI-Basic programs for my TI Calculators. Presently, I own a TI-83 and a TI-89, both of which I have recently rediscovered. My TI-83 was fortunate enough to have a working backup battery, which allowed me to recover all my programs that I wrote in high school, which are located in `ti-83/classic`. Unfortunately, My TI-89 programs were lost.

My goals are to translate these programs (at least Lightsabers! and Stocks 2000) to work on the TI-89 (as I was starting to do back in high school), as well as create remastered versions of these programs by optimizing and bugfixing my old code.

As far as new goals, I am looking to replace my TI-83 (which has a broken data port) with a new TI-84 CE Python, which I'm hoping to port my games over to as well. I anticipate the most extensive versions of my games to be written on the TI-84 CE Python, once I have fixed themm for the TI-83 and TI-89.
